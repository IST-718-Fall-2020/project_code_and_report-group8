IST718_InitialEDA_Group8.ipynb - Contains basic variable manipulations, data wrangling codes and EDA\
IST718_Feature_selection_and_reduction_AND_Clustering_Group8.ipynb - Contains feature bucketing codes, Feature importance rf model and a song recommendation engine kmeans clustering model
IST718_SupervisedModelCodes_Group8 - Contains all the supervised models for genre classification wwith hyperparamter tuning

The datasets have been uploaed to a cloud repository. All the main blocks have been commented. All the codes have been developed using pyspark.
